# Known Issues

## Cmd key stuck while switching between apps with Cmd Tab

After switching apps with the `Cmd-Tab` shortcut, when you return to the same app, the `Cmd` key is still pressed and the shortcuts help window shown. You can then press `w`, `t`, etc without having the `Cmd` key pressed.

> This is a known issue within iOS 13, and to get Apple to solve it we need your help. Please create a bug report within [Feedback Assistant](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com). We suggest that you use a similar title to ours: "Cmd key stuck while switching between apps with Cmd-Tab".

Here are two recordings that show the issue: `Cmd-tab` in [Pages.app](https://youtu.be/x0foV_ONDmk) & `Cmd-tab` in [Safari](https://youtu.be/-7LayQvtmPQ).

## Spacebar suddenly didnâ€™t work?

Go to iOS Settings -> Accessibility -> Full Keyboard Access -> Commands -> Activate and change `Space` to `shift + space` or other shortcut.

That way you will have full keyboard access and spacebar working in Blink
