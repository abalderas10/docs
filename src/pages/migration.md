# Migrate from Blink Shell 14

First of all, you can continue using Blink Shell 14 or Legacy app after dismissing the initial prompt. The app you purchased should continue working seamlessly with the operating system and version you acquired it for. Appleâ€™s iOS updates may affect its performance.

On February 9, 2022, we launched Blink Shell, Build & Code app, version 15, replacing the old version, Blink Shell 14. This is a new app and we renamed the old version as Legacy to indicate its end of cycle, as announced in-app and on social media. As a way to thank our loyal users, we created a migration process so they could keep using Blink Classic features and receive new updates. 

Blink Shell, Build & Code now also offers [two subscriptions](https://blink.sh/#choose-package) for accessing the latest features. These aren't mandatory for using Blink Classic, but if you choose to subscribe, we appreciate your support.

PS May 22nd 2023: Although we have been doing manual migrations past the April 15th deadline to help those users who reached out to us, we are unfortuantely not able to leverage this method anymore.

**PS PS: Why we cannot continue migrating users.** When we launched the new app, we were forced by Apple to do so under a new Company account (same company, different countries). After reaching out multiple times to them, they were not able to just transfer our new company information, forcing us to release a new app and starting over. 

We still wanted to help our previous users so to redeem the new app, we had to develop an automated flow the user would start in the new app, in order to redeem the receipt from the previous app. This required a platform in the backend that increased in complexity and we feared at one point would also stop working. Additionally, the old company would close and it would be illegal to continue operating and updating the old app so migrations would work. We set a deadline (April 15th 2023) giving everyone more than a year and a half, but at the same time creating urgency somusers did it on time. 

Tens of thousands of users migrated before the deadline. We are still very
 sorry if you found yourself left behind. We honestly tried to do everything that was in our hands.
