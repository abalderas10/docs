# Migrate from Blink Shell 14

On February 9, 2022, we launched Blink Shell, Build & Code app, version 15, replacing the old version, Blink Shell 14. We renamed the old version as Legacy and stopped updating it, as announced in-app and on social media. As a way to thank our loyal users, we created a migration process so they could keep using Blink Classic features and receive new updates. Though the Legacy version can still be downloaded and used, Appleâ€™s iOS updates may affect its performance.

Blink Shell, Build & Code now also offers [two subscriptions](https://blink.sh/#choose-package) for accessing the latest features. These aren't mandatory for using Blink Classic, but if you choose to subscribe, we appreciate your support.

By April 15, 2023, we successfully transitioned all interested users to the new Blink.

PS May 22nd 2023: Although we have been doing manual migrations past April 15th to help those users who reached out to us, we are unfortuantely not able to leverage this method anymore. We are very sorry if you find yourself in this situation, but we have done everything we can.
