# Snips

[![img](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png)](https://xkcd.com/1168)

Finding the perfect command incantation in endless internet searches? Tricky. Finding it again weeks after in your history? Frustrating. That we all suffer this for the same commands? Insane! That your whole team has to go through this endless loop? A big time waste.

Snips can act as sophisticated aliases to expedite workflows, tackle complex commands, and efficiently retrieve them later. Snips can also store important text snippets such as environment variables and secrets, so you don't have to context switch looking for them. 

Snips are simple and text-based, with no complex XML or YAML structures. This simplicity ensures they are easy and efficient to maintain and distribute on multiple platforms, enabling very cool scenarios. 

We organized snips into Indexes. Your Index is unique to you and your devices. Other Indexes focus on optimizing your usage of familiar CLI tools. And within your team, Indexes are a way to share workflows or playbooks to get to work at speed.

As snips evolve, they will become a fundamental component of future Blink functionality. Let's dive in!

## How to use snips

To open the snips prompt, use  `CMD`+`<` or select Snips through the contextual menu (double tap `âŒ˜` in the software keyboard).

Start typing `ping`, and you will see a list of snips as you type. The default Index provides common actions for Blink usage and remote servers. Select the first snip for the ping command.

Snips may contain template tags to fill out before executing. Fill this one out with *www.google.com*. Once Completed (`tab`), press Send (`CMD`+`ENTER`).

A snip name has **folder** and **action** components. Folders help organize snips in the Index; the action usually describes what will happen. You can browse all the folders inside the default Index (repo).

We designed the snips prompt to be fast and accurate when you need it. The first word will do a fuzzy search on names and quickly surface matches. For example, search for `bk` to find all the Blink-specific commands.

Every word after that will perform a search inside the content of the displayed snips, which is useful if you are searching for a specific flag or text. For example, type `curl Content-Type`.

### Special Shortcuts

We built-in some shortcuts to speed things up and empower special scenarios:

- With an empty prompt, pressing enter will take you to Scratch Mode. Perfect for when you copy a command in a tutorial that may need some tweaking before sending.
- You can directly send to the terminal as-is from the prompt by using `CMD`+`ENTER`. Or you can copy to the clipboard by using `CMD`+`SHIFT`+`C`. These are useful if you don't need to fill out any template, like an alias.
- Similarly, from the editor, you can use `CMD`+`ENTER` to directly send the snip.
- Snips can work on Blink Code too! Useful for coding snippets you want to keep around or terminal actions.

## How to create a snip

When your search does not match any snip at the prompt, a button will automatically appear to create one.

Naming your snip is important so you can surface them quickly. We have a few (under construction) guidelines from what we learnt using it and creating our default Index. 

We recommend using names that indicate the action or what is expected instead of the command itself. *Examples*. Check our default Index repository for more guidelines. 

A snip can also contain template tags to fill out using the `${tag_name}` notation. Some tips:

After you finish, click on the `Save` button. Blink saves your snip in your Index under the specified folder and name. From then on, you can use it from the prompt.

Your local Index resides in the `.blink/snippets` folder. Local snips always shadow other locations, so your local snips using the same name can customize an existing action to your liking. Ie, you can add extra flags to a command like ping.
